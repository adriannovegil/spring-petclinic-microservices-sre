# Chaos experiments

Following you can read all the information about the chaos experiments defined in the project.

You can execute:

- chaos using shell scripts
- chaos using Spring Boot Chaos Monkey interacting directly with the framework
- Chaos using Chaos Toolkit and Spring Boot Chaos Monkey

## Configure Spring Boot Chaos Monkey

The project comes with the Spring Boot Chaos Monkey configured for the following services:

* `customers-service`
* `visits-service`
* `vets-service`

Adding the following dependency:

```
  <!-- Chaos Monkey -->
  <dependency>
      <groupId>de.codecentric</groupId>
      <artifactId>chaos-monkey-spring-boot</artifactId>
  </dependency>
```

And activating the Spring Configuration at global level (`application.yml`):

```
# Chaos Engineering
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: chaos-monkey
management.endpoint.chaosmonkey.enabled: true
chaos:
  monkey:
    enabled: true
    watcher:
      component: false
      controller: false
      repository: false
      rest-controller: false
      service: false
```

You can read more about the possible configuration options [here](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/latest/#_properties).

## Fire the Chaos Interacting Directly With Spring Boot Chaos Monkey

In order to active Spring Boot Chaos Monkey's assault options and component instrumentation, you need to call the project's API.

For your convenience we're providing a [script](./scripts/chaos) that turns on various watchers and attacks. To print out the usage description just call the script without any parameters.

```
$ ./chaos/chaos-monkey/call_chaos.sh
usage: ./scripts/chaos/call_chaos.sh: <customers|visits|vets> <attacks_enable_exception|attacks_enable_killapplication|attacks_enable_latency|attacks_enable_memory|watcher_enable_component|watcher_enable_controller|watcher_enable_repository|watcher_enable_restcontroller|watcher_enable_service|watcher_disable>
First pick either customers, visits or vets
Then pick what to enable. Order matters!
Example
./scripts/chaos/call_chaos.sh visits attacks_enable_exception watcher_enable_restcontroller
```

The script takes in at minimum 2 parameters.

 * First provides the name of the application for which you want to turn on Chaos Monkey features.
 * The subsequent ones will enable attacks and watchers.

The name of the desired feature maps to a json file that gets updated to `http://localhost:${PORT}/actuator/chaosmonkey/assaults` and `http://localhost:${PORT}/actuator/chaosmonkey/watchers` respectively. Example of enabling exception assault via rest controllers for the visits microservice:

```
$ ./chaos/chaos-monkey/call_chaos.sh visits attacks_enable_exception watcher_enable_restcontroller
```

The default assault configuration is set to fail every 5th request. That means that the first four will work as if Chaos Monkey was be disabled.

## Fire the Chaos Using Chaos Toolkit

[Chaos Toolkit](https://chaostoolkit.org/) have support for Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot so that you can run a variety of chaos engineering probes and actions against your Spring Boot applications and services including:

- __Enabling and Disabling the Chaos Monkey__ on a specific service at runtime (useful for turning on the Chaos Monkey support for only the duration of your chaos engineering experiment).
- __Enabling and Configuring chaos assaults__ on a specific service at runtime.
- __Inspecting and recording the configuration of the Chaos Monkeyâ€™s watcher and assaults__ through probes in your experiment. Useful for capturing this information for further analysis after your experiments conclude.

Install chaos toolkit. You can do it following the [official documentation](https://chaostoolkit.org/reference/usage/install/)

Set virtual environment in python and install [chaostoolkit-spring](https://chaostoolkit.org/drivers/spring/)

```
$ python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/chaostk
$ source  ~/.venvs/chaostk/bin/activate
$ pip install chaostoolkit-spring
```

Run the experiment:

```
chaos run ./chaos/chaos-toolkit/[experiments].json
```

You can find all the Chaos Toolkit experiments in `./chaos/chaos-toolkit`

## Fire the Chaos Using Shell Scripts

You can execute additional chaos experiment using a collection of shell script located on `./chaos/chaos-scripts`.

To run the experiments, just execute any of the shell scripts and wait to the magic happens ;-)
